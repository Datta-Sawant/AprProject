## Introduction

    **Predicted Attribute :** Different Species of Iris plant.




- This Web App is deployed to cloud (AWS EC2) where it can be accesssed. Running last command above will prompt that server is running on port 8080  <b> i.e. ec2-52-66210-51.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com.8080 </b>
Now just load your cloud url in browser (for me it was ), website will open but it will not work unless I run this app's server in virtual OS Ubuntu.
